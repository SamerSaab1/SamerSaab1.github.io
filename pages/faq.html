    <h2 class="card-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Q1. Why isn’t this list integrated into ORBIT conference grades?</h3>
    <p>
      Because ORBIT conference grades are designed for proceedings-centric venues. Applying the same grading logic to non-proceedings
      meetings would introduce systematic bias.
    </p>

    <h3>Q2. Are these meetings “better” than proceedings conferences?</h3>
    <p>No. They represent different scholarly ecosystems. Many disciplines communicate impact through meetings without proceedings.</p>

    <h3>Q3. Why are some famous meetings missing?</h3>
    <p>
      Inclusion requires stable, verifiable public evidence and review. Some meetings have not yet been reviewed or lack stable documentation.
    </p>

    <h3>Q4. Can a meeting appear in both ORBIT and this list?</h3>
    <p>Yes in principle, but overlap is rare because the publication ecosystems differ.</p>

    <h3>Q5. Will this list be updated?</h3>
    <p>Yes. The list is versioned and may expand as evidence-backed suggestions are added.</p>

    <h3>Q6. What if a prestigious meeting I recognize is not included here?</h3>
    <p>
      This list is not exhaustive. Absence does not imply lower standing; it may simply mean the meeting has not yet been reviewed or lacks
      stable public evidence. Evidence-backed suggestions are welcome.
    </p>
